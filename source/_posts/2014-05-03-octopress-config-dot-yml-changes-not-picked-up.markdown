#### Issue: 
The <code>_confg.yml</code> changes are not picked when you deploy to github pages using <code>rake generate deploy</code>

#### Cause
I had <code>rake preview</code> running another tab, it was started with older version of the <code>_confg.yml</code>. This was also generating the html files into same <code>\_deploy</code> folder. Hence when you run <code>rake generate deploy</code>, it was pushing html generated by <code>rake preview</code> task.

#### Solution
Before running <code>rake generate deploy</code>, make sure you are not running <code>rake preview</code> or <code>rake watch</code> in any window or tab.
